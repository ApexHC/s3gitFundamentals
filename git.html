<!--I am using html as a markup tool for my git instructions:

    Git is a version control system that allows us to track changes and commit them to history.   

# git config - when first setting up git, you'll need to work with git config commands in order to set up your identity.  For example, your identity can be set up with commands such as:

git config --global user.name "Arnold Schwartzeneger"
git config --global user.email arnoldS@terminator.com

Underneath this code block we will add a link to the git documentation about the first time git setup.  
For more information, view the [first time git setup] (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) document.
